# Other Hobbies

### Real Estate
At the moment I am studying to get my license to buy and sell real estate. I also have experience working with real estate investment corporations with I was in the Marine Corps. 

### Coffee
I love coffee! I love trying new types of coffees. Some methods I use to frequently brew my coffee include french press, chemex (pour over), lattes with moka pot, and turkish coffee. It is a dream of mine to go to Japan to try Japanese aged coffee.

### App Development
I think making apps and coding in general is just super fascinating!

### Cyber Security
Cyber Security is a lot of fun and I love the idea of hacking. I would be a hacking vigilante, but I'm also a coward who doesn't like to break the law. So hopefully I can do some white hat hacking in the future.
