Hi. My name is Trevor and with this final Project I would like to make a site that explains who I am, the hats I wear, and what I like to do in my freetime. This site will be broken into 5 pages. These pages are as follows:

1. Home Page. Congratulations! You've made it here! 
2. [School Life](https://gigglebits.github.io/IT1000Final/SchoolLife.md)
3. [Work Life](https://gigglebits.github.io/IT1000Final/WorkLife.md) 
4. [Favorite Hobby](https://gigglebits.github.io/IT1000Final/FavoriteHobby.md)
5. [Other Interests](https://gigglebits.github.io/IT1000Final/OtherInterests.md)
